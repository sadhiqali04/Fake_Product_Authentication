# Fake-Product-Detection
My first Mini-Project 

## Project Overview :

This Project aims to detect fake products using a QR code generator. It leverages blockchain technologies to ensure the authenticity and traceability of products.

## Technologies Used :

### Blockchain
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity**: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum development.

### Frontend
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## Project Description

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to identify fake products through the use of blockchain technology and QR codes. Each product is assigned a unique QR code that can be scanned to verify its authenticity.

### How It Works
1. **QR Code Generation**: Each product is assigned a unique QR code generated by the system.
2. **Blockchain Integration**: The product details are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
3. **Verification**: Users can scan the QR code to check the product's authenticity through the blockchain records.

### Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Ensures that product information cannot be tampered with, thanks to blockchain's decentralized nature.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Immediate verification of product authenticity by scanning the QR code.

## Getting Started
